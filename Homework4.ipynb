        "Someone from SNAILAB theorized that knowing the genus of the plant which the leaf belongs to should help predict the genus of the snail, as certain snails are attracted to certain plants. However, the dataset does not contain plant names, and either way, plant identification requires additional time and skill.\n",

(0.9p) You will use several clustering methods: [Affinity Propagation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.AffinityPropagation.html), [DBSCAN](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN.html), [Spectral Clustering](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.SpectralClustering.html), and [KMeans](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html#sklearn.cluster.KMeans). They allow to provide different clustering parameters. Create a list `cluster_setups` containing `tuple[str, Callable, dict]` items (setups), where `str` is a short model name just for printing purposes, `Callable` is the clustering function (which you will call), and `dict` is a dictionary of 1-2 parameters to provide to that function.\n",

        "      - For Affinity Propagation, use 2-3 different `damping` values between 0.6 and 0.9;\n",
        "      - For Spectral Clustering and KMeans, use 4-5 `n_clusters` values between 3 and 20.\n",

        "3. (1.0p) For each setup in `cluster_setups`, fit a clustering model on `plants` data and get the preidcted labels for all plants. Save the labels into a dictionary `obtained_clusters` which should be of type `dict[str, list]`, The `str` keys should be some kind of automatically generated short model descriptions (e.g. use f-string and include used parameter values in it). The `list` values should be lists of predicted cluster labels.\n",
